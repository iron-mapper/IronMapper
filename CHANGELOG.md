# Changelog

## 1.1.1

### Fixed

- **The `IronMapper` package now ships the source generator.** 1.1.0 contained only `lib/`,
  so the generator never loaded in consuming projects and no `MapTo*` methods were generated.
  `IronMapper.Generator.dll` and `IronMapper.CodeFixes.dll` are now packed into
  `analyzers/dotnet/cs`; Roslyn (`Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.*`) is not a package dependency.
- `IronMapper.Extensions.DI` no longer excludes analyzers from its `IronMapper` dependency,
  so the generator also runs in projects that reference only the DI package.
- Package metadata, README and CI badge point to <https://github.com/iron-mapper/IronMapper>.

### Build

- CI packs both packages, verifies the `.nupkg` layout and builds a consumer project
  (`tests/IronMapper.PackageConsumer`) against the packed package from a local feed
  (`eng/verify-package.ps1`). The publish workflow runs the same check before pushing
  and requires the tag to match `<Version>` in `Directory.Build.props`.
