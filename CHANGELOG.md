# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- **Mappings of `internal` types no longer fail with CS0050/CS0051.** Generated methods (`MapToX`, the in-place
  overload, `MapToXList`, `MapToXArray`) were always `public`. They now get the lower effective accessibility of the
  source and destination types (containing types and generic type arguments included): `public` or `internal`.
  Applies to `[MapTo]`/`[MapFrom]` and `MappingProfile` mappings.
- Generated code uses fully qualified type names, so public types nested in other types and generic types
  (e.g. `Box<Payload>`) as source/destination now compile (previously CS0234/CS0305).
- `IMapper` (`IronMapper.Extensions.DI`) also finds `internal` generated methods.

### Added

- Diagnostic `IM0010` (error): a mapping whose source or destination is (or is nested in, or has a type argument that is)
  a `private`/`protected`/`private protected` type is not generated, and the error names the inaccessible type.
  Other mappings are still generated.

## 1.1.1

### Fixed

- **The `IronMapper` package now ships the source generator.** 1.1.0 contained only `lib/`,
  so the generator never loaded in consuming projects and no `MapTo*` methods were generated.
  `IronMapper.Generator.dll` and `IronMapper.CodeFixes.dll` are now packed into
  `analyzers/dotnet/cs`; Roslyn (`Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.*`) is not a package dependency.
- `IronMapper.Extensions.DI` no longer excludes analyzers from its `IronMapper` dependency,
  so the generator also runs in projects that reference only the DI package.
- Package metadata, README and CI badge point to <https://github.com/iron-mapper/IronMapper>.

### Build

- CI packs both packages, verifies the `.nupkg` layout and builds a consumer project
  (`tests/IronMapper.PackageConsumer`) against the packed package from a local feed
  (`eng/verify-package.ps1`). The publish workflow runs the same check before pushing
  and requires the tag to match `<Version>` in `Directory.Build.props`.
